## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains an [Ansible][ansible] playbook for installing and configuring the dead simple Nomad cluster for the `iddqd.uk` resources and applications. Where possible, working is automated with bots and GitHub actions.

The core of the cluster consists of the following applications:

- [Consul][consul] (service-discovery and distributed key-value storage)
- [Nomad][nomad] (simple and flexible scheduler and orchestrator)
- [Docker][docker] (each run application deployed as a docker container)

In addition, I decided to use the following applications:

- [Gluster][gluster] (persistent data across each node in the cluster, e.g. for the Nomad containers)

Since this is a simple cluster (minimal nodes count is 2), Nomad, Consul and Gluster are used as a server and client on each machine simultaneously. Load balancing, logs aggregation, monitoring, alerting, and other services are not included - to keep this playbook simple I prefer to install them separately (as a services in docker containers).

## Requirements

- 2 (or more) machines
- 2 network interfaces on each machine - public and private
- Successfully tested on Debian 11 (amd64)

## Running

Please, follow the next checklist:

- [x] Make a file `./.vault_password` with the [vault password][ansible_vault]
- [x] Install playbook requirements - `ansible-galaxy install -r ./requirements.yml`
- [x] Check (or create new) the inventory file (for required environment - `local|production`)

After the checklist passing, you can run the playbook:

```shell
$ ansible-playbook ./site.yml -i ./inventory/local # for local
$ ansible-playbook ./site.yml -i ./inventory/prod  # for production
```

> âš  Some services bind on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), so you should protect them with firewall rules, or use an external firewall!

### Secrets

For a making encrypted value in the playbook, you can use the following command (file with the vault password `./.vault_password` should exist):

```shell
$ ansible-vault encrypt_string 'your secret value' --name 'the_secret'

the_secret: !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          65666362303663356230373118643061636136336431623634633237393132663661663531643266
          3066643164333730303933663737386139326463646661640a666534306235373236303464396436
          34346139666164643934393763373765396134656230626639623164373237616462313431376266
          3934303232303432380a663736323636626134323364303336363566353532313539316436343461
          66383365396138356666353832363030363361613537316235363638646639316663
Encryption successful
```

And otherwise, for the secret reading you can:

```shell
$ ansible localhost -m ansible.builtin.debug -a var="some.secret_key" -e "@inventory/prod/group_vars/all.yml"
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "nomad.secret_key": "your secret value"
}
```
